<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello, my name is dobin Jeong from South korea. I love traveling and meeting new people. That's why I decided to study Spsnish as a major.
  So, I'm going to write about my Travel here in this website. If anyone is interested in my story, please come in and share your experience! <br> <strong>HOPE YOU ENJOY IT A LOT !</strong>
</p>
<p> I've been more than 13 countires, 40 cites in the world. Asia, Africa, Europe and Australia, these are the continents I've been visited to. I have been always dreaming of creating my own travel web site to share with others and finally I started to move on.
  I am super duper excited for this experience. I wish I could finsh all the process to make my first web site! </P>
